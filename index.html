      <p>
        I’m Nithin. I like exploring new things whenever I get the chance. I feel I’m at a good stage in life—old enough to value the present, young enough to shape the future. This is my space to share a little about myself.

I’m currently a CA Foundation student with a curiosity for learning and a quiet enthusiasm for life. I enjoy watching anime, movies, and series; coding; playing chess; and capturing and editing moments. I have an appreciation for simple pleasures—the wind, the sunlight (not the harsh midday sun), the ocean, rain, and music. I also enjoy reading storybooks from time to time.

My aim is to become both strong and thoughtful, so I can navigate life confidently and protect those I care about. At the same time, I love taking the time to appreciate the beauty of nature and the world around us.
